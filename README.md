### Technologies

* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started): State container lib. `npm install --save redux`

* [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/quick-start): Official React bindings for Redux. Makes the connection between React and Redux. `npm install --save react-redux`

* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk): With a plain basic Redux store, you can only do simple synchronous updates by dispatching an action. Middleware extend the store's abilities, and let you write async logic that interacts with the store. Thunks are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests. `npm install --save redux-thunk`

### Info

* [React.Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html): A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
